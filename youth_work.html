        <h3>Little people, doing little things, in little places, everywhere, can change the world.</h3>
        <p>I have been a participant, a group leader, a facilitator in more than 10 mobilities and I can still feel the Erasmus+ magic. There’s something special about people ready to change the world. Being in a like-minded environment, sharing ideas, goals and dreams with people who become your family in a period as short as 10 days, that’s the true meaning safety and comfort outside your comfort zone. </p>

        <h1 class="top">Debate Club</h1>
        <h3>Don't raise your voice, improve your argument!</h3>
        <p>Debate and constructive criticism have been present since the beginning of time. Since 1st year of high school, I’m actively involved in Youth Educational Forum and their debate events, and for 2 years now I’m teaching highschoolers the art of debate. We practice the “World School Debate Format”, I teach it in a very informal kind of way, learning by doing. I know that being active in popular topics has helped me form an opinion, widen my horizons, and shaped me as a person. That’s why working as a trainer and spreading that knowledge is one of the most fulfilling and satisfying things for me.</p>

        <h3>Inovation. Creativity. Teamwork. Visualisation. Rapid Development.</h3>
        <p>Attending on hackathons and events of competitive character, is my way of pushing my boundaries, and creating my own luck. In the spirit of Zuckerberg’s quote “Move fast and brake things. Unless you’re braking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.”, I find hackathons as a gateway to reach my creative potential in a team environment.  So far, I’ve attended 3, and took a top place in all of them. Below is a link of a short film we created in 72h, during last year’s CineDays.</p>
